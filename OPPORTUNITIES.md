3. Missing Features (The "Roadmap")
Island Models: 
Implementing "Migration" where multiple independent populations evolve separately and occasionally exchange their best individuals. This is a classic way to prevent premature convergence to local optima.

CMA-ES Integration: 
I noticed placeholders for coefficient in LivingTreeGene intended for Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy. Completing this implementation would provide a world-class optimization tool.

4. Benchmarking
The library would benefit from a dedicated Benchmarks target with standard problems (Traveling Salesperson, Rastrigin function, Symbolic Regression) to track performance gains/regressions over time.
